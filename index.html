<p>Getting a beautiful bouquet of color each week is such a treat and always brightens our day having</p>
<p>them in the office. People always comment on how gorgeous they are and each week is so different</p>
<p>and unique, it's always a fun surprise. You might not know how much fresh flowers can improve your</p>
<p>mood, until you do, then you simply can't live without them!</p></section>

<section class="titulitos"><h5>Morgan, BLOC Co-Working Spaces</h5></section>

<section><p>I was first introduced to the joy of getting a Native Poppy delivery every month from my daughter.</p>
<p>After a year of lovely arrangements arriving at my door I added a second monthly delivery. I have so</p>
<p>enjoyed the beautiful, surprising, elegant arrangements that arrive every other week. They are</p>
<p>always beautiful, fresh and vibrant and include a lovely mix of unusual and classic blossoms.</p>
<p>Whenever I want a flower delivery for friends or loved ones, I can always count on Native Poppy to</p>
<p>deliver their particular brand of love and joy.</p></section>

<p>The Native Poppy flower subscription was the perfect gift for my Mother-In-Law! Native Poppy’s</p>    
<p>bouquets are always so fresh and beautiful and she loves receiving them right to her door each</p>
<p>month. The Native Poppy staff have been incredibly helpful and have assisted us with rescheduling a</p>
<p>couple of her subscription deliveries when she was out of town. I can’t recommend them enough and</p>
<p>will definitely be gifting more flower subscriptions in the future!</p>
